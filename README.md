# GPT Assets Library — Central Hub

This repository serves as a central asset store for multiple GPT chatbots, starting with GPT Alex and GPT Valor. It contains diagrams and images organized by GPT and subject.

## Structure

- `Alex/` — Contains the diagrams and logos for GPT Alex. Within this folder, subject-specific subfolders (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, etc.) organize the diagrams, and `assets/logos` holds Alex-related icons.
- `Valor/` — Contains logos and assets for GPT Valor. See `Valor/index.md` for details on available logos and references to Valor's architecture documentation.
- `.gitignore` and `LICENSE.txt` are included as standard project files.

## Purpose

This structure ensures GitHub correctly tracks all GPT-specific folders while keeping the repository modular. Future updates will populate the folders with diagrams and icons for each GPT as needed.
